						<h2>Coronavirus</h2>
						<p>
							Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds,
							they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some
							cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal 
							varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause 
							hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.

				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory
					infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America.[16] Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the 
					first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection 
					of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40–90%.
					Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in 1933.
					The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated
					the virus for the first time in 1937. The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain. In the late 1940s, 
					two more animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain disease (murine encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 
					that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered. It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses 
					were related.
				</p>
				<h2>Origin</h2>
				<p>
					The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE,
					although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term
					coevolution with bat and avian species. The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been 
					placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and of 
					the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural 
					reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and 
					birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). The large number and global range of bat and 
					avian species that host viruses has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.

				<h2>Vaccine</h2>
				<p>
					As of 18 February 2021, at least seven different vaccines across three platforms have been rolled out 
					in countries. Vulnerable populations in all countries are the highest priority for vaccination.

						<h3>Vaccination in India</h3>
						<p>The COVID vaccine was launched on 16th January, 2021. The first group includes healthcare and
							frontline workers. The second group to receive COVID 19 vaccine will be persons over 50 
							years of age and persons under 50 years with comorbid conditions.The national vaccination drive 
							began on 16 January 2021, across 3,006 vaccination centres.Each vaccination centre will offer 
							either Covishield or Covaxin, but not both. Some states have decided to use only Covishield as 
							the “default option” and keep their Covaxin doses as a “buffer stock”. Since Covaxin has not 
							completed phase-3 trials, those receiving it will need to sign a signed consent form.
